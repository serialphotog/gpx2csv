# Gpx2Csv

This is a very simple command line utility that fills a niche use I had.

I have thousands of waypoints stored in my GPS that consist of waterfalls and arches. I frequently back these waypoints up as GPX files. I wanted a way that I could view this data in a more convenient format than GPX, so I wrote this utility to write the GPX files to CSV.

## Usage

```
$ python gpx2csv.py --input INPUT_GPX.gpx --output OUTPUT_FILE.csv
```
